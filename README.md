***PLEASE NOTE:** This version of the FruxePi is still under development and in prototype by ghabs tech. Our goal is to make this application effortless to deploy and run on your Raspberry Pi. However, until we get all the bugs worked out, this project may require the knowledge of an advanced Pi user. Nonetheless, if you are keen on this project and are having issues deploying FruxePi, please create an issue explaining your problem or contact <hello@fruxe.co>.*

## FruxePi Overview

The FruxePi is a web application running on a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) which can be accessed from the browser on your local network. The application collects grow data from a variety of sensors and controls various operations such as lighting, ventilation and watering, using relay modules.

### Features

Using the browser-based dashboard, users can easily monitor the status of their growing environment and automate certain tasks. 

**The basic functionalies of the FruxePi include:**

- Monitor your growing climate (temperature and humidity).
- Chart visualizations for historical temperature and humidity data.
- Manage crops by tracking progress and time to harvest.
- Monitor soil moisture.
- Camera monitoring with periodic and manual photo capture.
- Manual and scheduled lighting control.
- Fan control both manually and exception based (temperature or humidity thresholds).
- Watering pump control and daily automation.
- User authentication and management.
- Track daily activity using blog-like journal.

## What parts will I need?

The FruxePi runs on the RaspberryPi using several sensors and relays:

|Part|Description|
| ------------- | ------------- |
|![Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/fruxefarms/FruxePi/blob/master/docs/img/raspberrypi.png?raw=true) | **Raspberry Pi**<br/> The FruxePi has been tested and runs well on the following models running Raspian:<br/>- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B <br/>- Raspberry Pi Model Zero W |
|![Climate Sensor](https://github.com/fruxefarms/FruxePi/blob/master/docs/img/climate_sensor.png?raw=true) | **Climate Sensor**<br/> The DHT22 is a basic digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin, no analog input pins needed.|
|![Moisture Probe](https://github.com/fruxefarms/FruxePi/blob/master/docs/img/moisture_sensor.png?raw=true)  | **Moisture Probe**<br/> The TE215 moisture probe is sensitive to ambient humidity and is used to detect the moisture content of the soil or growing medium. The module outputs a HIGH or LOW value when the the soil humidity exceeds a set threshold value. |
|![Relay Module](https://github.com/fruxefarms/FruxePi/blob/master/docs/img/relay.png?raw=true)|**5V Relay Modules**<br/> 5V Relay Modules are a great way to control high current and high voltage devices directly from the Raspberry Pi.|
|![Camera](https://github.com/fruxefarms/FruxePi/blob/master/docs/img/camera.png?raw=true)|**Raspberry Pi Camera**<br/> The Raspberry Pi Camera Module is the official camera product from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. The FruxePi has been tested using the 8MP Camera Module v2 (2016).|

Please see the [full list](https://docs.fruxe.co/#/requirements) of requirements and further information regarding each component.
